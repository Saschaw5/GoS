## ChangeLog

- v0.1.2 - 13/09/2020 - Move into Plutonium proper with new installation option; Check Dependency script fixed; Version incremented Compatibility with: FVTT Core 0.66 and DND5e 0.95

- v0.1.1 - 25/07/2020 - Removed Tab prefix to overcome Beyond20 failing.; Updated to DnD system 0.94. Removed Tab prefix to overcome Beyond20 failing. Applied Tim Posney's excellent [**Merge Walls**](https://gitlab.com/tposney/mergewalls/tree/master) to address issues with the Roll20 exports (stacking walls and points creating unneeded additional walls/vertices to try to factor off for Lighting); Started reducing /compressing graphics and branching off for community enhanced versions
- v0.1.0 - 10/07/2020 - Combined Module & World files into single deployment; added <finddependencies.js script
- v0.0.8 - 28/06/2020 - Added Dancing Light for candles/fires; Used alternativeUpdated maps IMR; 
- v0.0.7 - 28/06/2020 - Stated using [**Parallaxia**](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/parallaxia/) to add visual effects (rolling waves/train moving/fog rolling in) 
 - GoS; KKR; and some others to create motion effects.
- v0.0.6 - 14/06/2020 - Started redefining Maps with significant number of walls which caused issues with performance on older machines (ie use a X versus 20+ walls to define a circle/pilar - invisible walls for portcullis/jail cells versus multiple small walls.)
- v0.0.5 - 11/06/2020 - Updated teleport configuration to remove the PRIOR token so players still on floor x don't see what appears to be a glitched / dead token atop the stairs; versus the token becoming hidden to emulate them leaving.
- v0.0.4 - 09/06/2020 - > removing the unneeded extra bar on tokens; Using Telelport link stairs between levels for player nagivation
- v0.0.3 - 22/05/2020 - Added Fireplace Crackle to fireplaces/Tavern/Town Ambient Noises
- v0.0.2 - 02/05/2020 - re-Assigned Walls and assigned Windows and Doors. Fixed bad imports and replaced some maps. Remove token sheets from navigation bar (Unnecessary).
